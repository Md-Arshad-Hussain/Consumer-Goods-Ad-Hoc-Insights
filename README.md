# Consumer Goods Ad Hoc Insights – AtliQ Hardware SQL Project

## 🧠 Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardwares is a fictional company and one of the leading producers of computer hardware in India, with a growing global presence. The company specializes in selling computers and related accessories across various markets.

Despite its success, the management team identified a gap in their ability to make quick and data-informed decisions. Business teams often lacked access to timely insights, leading to delays in strategic actions. To address this issue, Tony Sharma, the Director of Data Analytics at AtliQ, initiated a SQL Challenge to evaluate and recruit capable junior data analysts.

This challenge was designed not only to test technical proficiency in SQL but also to assess business thinking and communication skills, crucial for turning raw data into meaningful insights.
